        <h1> The 5 Technologies That Will Change The Future Of The Human Race </h1>
        <p> In my book, Tech Trends in Practice, I talk about a lot of technology trends that are already moving out of
            the R&D departments and into everyday life, but the following five I think will have the most profound
            impacts on our society and the human race as a whole.</p>
        <h2> Artificial Intelligence </h2>
        <p> Artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning refer to the ability of machines to learn and act
            intelligently, meaning they can make decisions, carry out tasks, and even predict future outcomes based on
            what they learn from data.

            AI and machine learning already play a bigger role in everyday life than you might imagine. Alexa, Siri,
            Amazon's product recommendations, Netflix’s and Spotify’s personalized recommendations, every Google search
            you make, security checks for fraudulent credit card purchases, dating apps, fitness trackers... All are
            driven by AI.
            AI is going to revolutionize almost every facet of modern life. Stephen Hawking said, “Success in creating
            AI would be the biggest event in human history.” And Hawking immediately followed that up with,
            “Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks."

            There are potentially huge risks for society and human life as we know it, particularly when you consider
            some countries are racing to develop AI-enabled autonomous weapons. AI and machine learning are the
            foundation on which many other technologies are built. For instance, without AI, we wouldn't have achieved
            the amazing advances in the Internet of Things, virtual reality, chatbots, facial recognition, robotics,
            automation, or self-driving cars, just to name a few.


        </p>
        <p>
            AI is also going to transform human jobs. AI-enabled automation will have a particularly significant impact
            and may lead to the displacement of many jobs. But rather than subscribing to a vision of a dystopian future
            where all human jobs are given over to robots, I believe AI will make our working lives better. AI will
            enhance the work of humans, and new jobs will arise to replace displaced jobs.

        <p>
            What's more, as machines become more intelligent and capable of carrying out more human tasks, I believe
            that our uniquely human capabilities, things like creativity, empathy, and critical thinking, will become
            all the more precious and valuable in the workplaces of the future.

            Gene Technology
        </h2>

        <p>
            Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of biology that focuses on the understanding and manipulation of DNA
            and genomes of living organisms. Gene editing is a group of technologies that enables genetic engineering in
            order to change the DNA and genetic structure of living organisms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Biotechnology is advancing to the point where it's viable to alter the DNA encoded within a cell; this will
            influence the characteristics or traits that its descendants will have. In plants, this could affect the
            number of leaves or their coloring, while in humans, it could affect their height, eye color, or their
            likelihood of developing diseases. This opens up a range of possibilities that are almost unlimited, as it
            means that any characteristic of a living organism that is inherited can theoretically be changed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Much of the work being done with gene editing is in the field of healthcare. Among the most exciting current
            projects is the correction of DNA mutations which can lead to serious illnesses such as cancer or heart
            disease. But, perhaps more than with any other technology, there are a huge number of ethical and legal
            concerns as well as "what if" questions when it comes to genetic manipulation and editing. Genome editing in
            humans is currently banned in many countries, including much of Europe, as its long-term results are not
            understood.
